# Hacky coroutine library for the Raspi Pico

I needed a way to jump between different "threads" of execution, without the overhead of real multi-threading.
Simple cooperative multi-tasking was good enough.

## Buyer beware

* No attempt at API stability, feel free to fork and change in any way you see fit.
* This lib is for me hacking on a lazy weekend afternoon, along the same line as the point above.
